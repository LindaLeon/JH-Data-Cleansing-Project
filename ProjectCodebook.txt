Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals in seconds (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

meanX: Mean value of X-axial signal for each subject performing a specific activity
meanY: Mean value of y-axial signal for each subject performing a specific activity
meanZ: Mean value of z-axial signal for each subject performing a specific activity
stdX: Mean standard deviation of X-axial signal for each subject performing a specific activity
stdY: Mean standard deviation of Y-axial signal for each subject performing a specific activity
stdZ: Mean standard deviation of Z-axial signal for each subject performing a specific activity
mean: Mean value of magnitude variable for each subject performing a specific activity
std:  Mean standard deviation of magnitude variable for each subject performing a specific activity
meanFreqX: Weighted average of the X-axial signal frequency to obtain a mean frequency for each subject performing a specific activity
meanFreqY: Weighted average of the Y-axial signal frequency to obtain a mean frequency for each subject performing a specific activity
meanFreqZ: Weighted average of the Z-axial signal frequency to obtain a mean frequency for each subject performing a specific activity
meanFreq: Weighted average of the magnitude variable frequency to obtain a mean frequency for each subject performing a specific activity
